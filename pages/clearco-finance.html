            <p><b> Vision: Help founders win</b>.</p>
            <p> <b>Mission: Eliminate barriers to access of capital.</b></p>

<p>Although the partnerships team was deprecated, I was still excited about working at Clearco.</p>

  <p>Luckily, through recognition of my previous work in partnerships, our president (Michele Romanow) and our VP of Finance (Michael Munroe) championed that I should join a new team.</p>

  <p>With a want to understand more of the backend financial systems, our product and infrastructure as a financing company, I took an interest in joining the Finance side of the org.</p>

  <p>After spending 8 months in the world of sales & partnerships, I started a new role as a Managerial Accountant reporting to our VP of Finance.</p>

<p id="learnings"><h4>Learnings</h4></p>
<p>All companies are performing a balancing act.</p>

<p>What's pulling on one end is the drive for growth and the natural timing of investment to return of capital.</p>

<p>On the other, a financial stack that's limited.</p>

<p>Understanding the financial stack of Clearco and how it directly related to business activities, is the most critical business lesson I've learned so far.</p>

<p>I've always wanted a rounded skill-set - but it is in this role that I've started to understand how important it is to see different sides of a company.</p>

<p>Although it (really) was exciting to rebuild some of our companies financial reporting - the role is too internal.</p>

<p>I want to build more for people, to be at the intersection of the internal and external.</p>

<p>The reasons I left are:
 <ul><li>Wanted to work on something that supports artists (overall vision).</li>
 <li>Wanted to work more at the intersection of internal and external.</li>
 <li>Wanted to have a different work culture.</li></ul></p>

<p>I'm now looking to join a larger team where I can leverage my diverse skill set to provide meaningful impact.</p>

<p><hr>
  <p>
 <p><b>Learnings:</b> <p>
   <p><ul>
    <li>Diversify your financial stack to align with purpose of capital.</li>
    <li>Data cleanliness is critical to control.</li>
    <li>Know executive priorities to provide relevant reporting.</li>
    <li>Although building quickly is important, it's important to set time apart to solve for tech debt.</li>
    <li>To successfully execute a project as a team, it's critical to align priorities and remove blockers.</li>

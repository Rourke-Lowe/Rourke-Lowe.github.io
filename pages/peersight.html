          <h3>Peersight</h2>
          <p name="situation"><h4>Situation</h4></p>
            <p> Vision: Make hiring more human.</p>
            <p> Mission: Bring scalable hiring to growing startups.</p>

<p>It was the last semester of university, the real world was waiting and I had to decide what I wanted to do next.</p>

<p>I applied to a select few larger companies based in Montreal with the goal of gaining some experience and having some stability, yet I didn&rsquo;t feel happy.</p>

<p>Feeling like I was quitting the startup life, I was ashamed and frustrated. I wanted to know what it was like to build a company before working at one.</p>

<p>A friend from highschool, Charlie (co-founder @ Clearbanc), approached me with an introduction to Michael (head of growth @ Setter, previously director of marketing @ CareGuide) who wanted to start something new.</p>

<p>Mike wanted to change how people applied to companies with a focus on helping people connect with the potential future teams they would be joining.</p>

<p>I was instantly pulled in by the mission of helping people connect with the best opportunities available (relating it to my work at ConcertConnect), and the opportunity to work with an extremely high-performing team.</p>

<p>Instead of studying for my finals I worked with Mike, Charlie, and a few others on the initial phases of the project, and an hour after my last final I packed my bags and hopped on a bus to Toronto.</p>

<p>Living in the same room as my now CEO, separated by a Japanese divider, my work at Peersight started.</p>

<p name="projects"><h4> Projects</h4></p>
<p> Goal: Focus on gaining organic users through content rich SEO optimized pages.</p>
<p> Built company pages similar to glassdoor, AngelList. Targeted high traffic, low ranking difficulty companies. Wrote over 100 unique pieces of long form content with a focus on high volume keywords and phrases. Automated company page generation, later a critical part of our 1300 pieces of unique content / week and our 2000 new users / week. Goal: Build company pages engaging teams and job seekers. Canvas&rsquo;d job seekers and university students for questions they wanted to ask teams before joining. Specced product changes for creating viral user generated content loops. Create lead lists of targeted users @ companies, later automating lead generation to over 5,000 leads / week. Tailor unique &lsquo;sales&rsquo; messages (questions) to 1,000 users / week, later automating this process. Goal: Develop pre-hiring process for clients. Sold packages to high growth startups to support in their hiring needs. Developed lists of leads for enterprise sales, later automating this process. Built automated hiring lead generation funnel - generating 50 - 100 qualified hires / week (out of 1000+ weekly applications). Interview strong candidates, support them with pre-interview prep and salary/role negotiations. </p>

<p name="learnings"><h4>Learnings</h4></p>
<p> Working eight months at Peersight I had learned beyond what I didn&rsquo;t know existed.</p>

<p>Most importantly, nothing can be exchanged for a great team.</p>

<p>Working with motivated, genuine, hard-working, intelligent and inspiring people is what made the experience unforgettable. I am now looking to join a similar team :) </p>

<p>I left as the company vision had shifted too far from what I wanted to support, and had burnt out trying to convince myself it was ok. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still convinced there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity within the market we were playing in, but for now I want to learn at a company with a more established vision that I&rsquo;m motivated by.</p>

<p>---</p>
 <p>Learnings: <p>
   Marketing is an analytical game. Having a growth mindset means always thinking about automation and scalability. Building and translating requirements means understanding who you&rsquo;re working with. Building a marketplace you must anchor one side with an independent value proposition. Everyone has the same amount of hours in a day. Learning how to do your work better is (almost) always worthwhile. It is always better to over-deliver. Being prompt is extremely valuable. Know when to stop working and rest. Question decisions but be respectful and understanding that you don&rsquo;t possess all knowledge. </p>

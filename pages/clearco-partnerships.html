          <h3>Clearco - Partnerships</h3>
          <br><p id="situation"><h4>Situation</h4></p>
            <p><b> Vision: Help founders win.</b>.</p>
            <p> <b>Mission: Eliminate barriers to access of capital.</b></p>
            <p>Returning to Toronto, I was excited about two companies in particular:
            <ul><li>Ada (then Ada Support)</li>
            <li>Clearco (then Clearbanc)</li></ul></p>
           
           <p>Both of the positions were exciting -- at Ada I would join as a technical sales consultant for integrating their AI customer success automation tool, at Clearco I would be leading up new partnerships initiatives.</p>
           
           <p>The criteria I evaluated against were:
          <ul><li>How much will I learn about Sales.</li>
          <li>How much will I learn about Finance.</li>
          <li>How much will I be able to manage myself.</li>
          <li>Which culture seemed 'faster'.</li></ul> </p>
           
           <p>Clearco was giving me everything I wanted. </p>
             
          <p>The opportunity to understand how capital flows, the ability to lead up a new initiative and manage all metrics, and the opportunity to practice my sales ability.</p>
           
           <p>Beyond this, Clearco's vision was to empower all businesses with easier access to capital for growth. With Peersight ultimately failing due to a lack of capital - I was motivated.
           
           <p>After being home for 2 weeks, I joined Clearco as the first Partnerships Services Manager.</p>

<p id="projects"><h4> Projects</h4></p>
<p> <b>Build a network of consultants who refer business and help grow our portfolio.</b></p>
<p><ul><li> Develop pitch & pitch deck targeted towards consultants in eCommerce and SaaS.
  <li>Targeted high traffic, low ranking difficulty companies to generate high volume of users through organic search.
    <li>Build pipeline of 1000 self prospected leads, messaging an average of 50 per day with 5-8 video calls.
      <li>Developed 6 strong partnerships, referring ~$2,000 in MRR per month. </p></li></ul>
        <p><b>Goal: Develop a community of accountants who refer companies in need of capital, and help our portfolio manage their finances.</b></p>
        <p><ul><li> Develop pitch & pitch deck targeted towards eCommerce and SaaS accountants.
                <li>Built a pipeline of 100 high value accountants, developed and executed named account strategy for each account.
                <li>Developed 15 strong partnerships, referring ~$3,000 MRR per month.</li>
                <li>Facilitated introductions of ~10 businesses per month to the accounting partner that best fit their needs.</li>
              </ul></p>
                <p><b> Goal: Rebuild our accounting export to better service our funded businesses and accounting partners.
                </b></p>
                <p><ul><li>Accounting information on our funding was very difficult to understand and export, making partnerships with accountants difficult to maintain, and resulted in churn from financially savvy customers.
                  <li>Drafted minimum viable product through product discovery interviews with accountants and funded businesses.
                    <li>Received executive alignment on need for improved reporting.
                      <li>Worked with Product and Engineering to implement and iterate on product. 
                      </ul> </p>

<p id="learnings"><h4>Learnings</h4></p>
<p> The unique position of building out a net new area of partnerships gave me the opportunity to work both inside the business (creating new content & strategy for partnerships etc.), and outside the business (developing the partnerships).</p>
  
  <p>Sales was truly the backbone of Clearco. Without a team constantly focussed on matching our product with other businesses needs, we would have had a minute percentage of the revenue we did.</p>
  
  <p>Managing the initiative became a fun exercise. My manager would have only an hour a week to help solve my problems. Each week we'd meet to share performance metrics, and unblock potential upcoming problems.</p>
  
  <p>Through these short interactions, I was able to improve my ability to foresee what might be potential blockers for achieving my OKRs, and clearly report on my performance.</p>
  
  <p>With the start of COVID, the team decided to restructure the organization in fear of the impact of a rapidly declining economy, including removing what was the Partnerships team.</p>

 <p><b>Learnings:</b> <p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Set objectives with measurable key results - review alignment weekly.
        <li>To gain interest in a product, you must understand the buyers needs.
          <li>Managing expectations clearly builds trust and eliminates mis-understanding.

            <li>Increasing close rate is only useful if the activity metrics are there.

              <li>Anyone could be a potential client or partner.
</ul> </p>

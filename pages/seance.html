            <p><b> Vision: Reset on my wants.</b></p>
            <p> <b>Mission: Build something that reflects my state of mind.</b></p>

            <p>Leaving Peersight was difficult -- we were a close group of friends, working on a hard problem, with the potential of helping thousands of people find more meaning in their life.</p>

            <p>And, I was mentally drained from working 80 hours week after week, with no wage and little equity.</p>
            
            <p>Looking into the future, there was little confidence that I'd find something I was passionate for again. Talking with some friends, I was recommended to slow down, and take the time to choose my next phase.</p>
            
            <p>During my most difficult times I always turned to writing, so I wanted to write something that reflected the chaos internal, and hopefully discover my unformed future want.</p>
            
            <p>I left for Barcelona with a daily budget of $18, and an intention to travel wherever I felt like it at the time, write, and listen to music.</p>
            
            <p>9 months later, after roaming around western Europe staying at friends places - spending time dancing in Barcelona, drinking in London, and exploring Paris -- and then climbing up the west coast of the Americas, surfing in Costa Rica, living in San Francisco, and hiking in the Rockies, I returned home.</p>
            
            <p>Writing had helped unveil my hidden biases, previous perspectives I held, which continued to linger unwanted. </p>
            
            <p>Returning home was exciting -- I knew what I wanted next.</p>

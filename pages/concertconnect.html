    <p><b>Vision: Change how live music is experienced.</b></p>
      <p> <b>Mission: Help bands and venues book live shows.</b></p>

    <p>The company was founded in 2015 while I was attending university at the John Molson School of Business in Montreal. </p>

    <p>With my first year being spent in residence at Loyola Campus, I had the opportunity to meet groups of artists who had moved to Montreal with the goal of &lsquo;making it&rsquo; - to live through their art.</p>

    <p>I soon realized a universal problem for the artists I talked to, a key element to profiting off their work was hosting events.</p>

    <p>Events in themselves are difficult to organize. They require a project management mindset, and for people who wanted to focus their energies on making art, running an event was at the bottom of their priority list.</p>

    <p>Having grown up surrounded by engineers, I felt there must be a more hands-off approach to organizing artistic events. </p>

    <p>After researching alternatives I felt the needs of my friends weren&rsquo;t being met, and I wanted to change that.</p>

    <p id="projects"><h4>Projects</h4></p>
    <p><b>Discovery</b></p>
    <p>Goal: Understand what a working product would look like.</p>

    <p><ul><li>Defined initial scope of project to be focussed on live music based on market analysis and my network.
      <li>Applied and was accepted to District 3 (Concordia funded Startup Incubator) as a solo founder to learn from mentors and be surrounded by like minded people.
        <li>Interviewed over 40% of Montreal&rsquo;s music venue program managers to determine their booking processes. Pitched idea gaining conceptual buy-in from 60%.
          <li>Interviewed over 100 different bands and independent musicians to determine their overall goals with live music, while mapping their current processes for booking shows.</ul></p>

    <p><b>Minimum Product</b></p>
    <p>Goal: Have a working system to help bands book live shows.</p>

    <p><ul><li>Reviewed interview notes to find underlying elements relevant to both bands and venues
      <li>Collected key venue information of over 100 venues in and around Montreal for bands through a second round of face to face interviews, phone calls, and online research.
         <li>Reached out to bands in my network looking to book live shows - helped them define what they were looking for and recommended venues based on style.
           <li>Helped bands draft proposal and reached out to venue booking managers with all critical information necessary for a show.
             <li>Helped 60 bands book shows with 7 venues leading to 300 less emails and a happier booking experience for both parties.</ul></p>

    <p><b>Initial Product Development</b></p>
    <p> Goal: Develop a product handling operational parts of booking live shows.</p>

    <p><ul><li>Reached out through my network and online platforms (AngelList) to build a team of volunteers.
      <li>Interviewed 2-3 candidates per role to find best role &amp; culture fit. (brought on 2 developers, 1 designer, 1 operations, 1 marketing).
        <li>Held weekly scrum sessions involving team at my apartment - walked through key value points for stakeholders and engaged team in prioritization of work.
          <li>Worked closely with developers to ensure scope didn&rsquo;t continuously expand and features were prioritized effectively.</ul></p>

    <p name="id"><h4> Learnings</h4></p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to fully write down everything I learned while trying to build this company.</p>

    <p>The biggest, I feel, is a good idea will get you nowhere if you don&rsquo;t put in consistent work.</p>

    <p>I was attending university, was a part of the varsity frisbee team, two case competition teams, and worked a part time job in a kitchen, while trying to build this company. </p>

    <p>It never went where it could because I didn&rsquo;t make the time to invest.</p>

    <p>We took about 10 months off sporadically for exams, summer, and other reasons. </p>

    <p>In the end, I found some students looking to continue helping bands with the information we learned, and I moved to Toronto for Peersight.</p>

  <p>
    <p><b>Learnings: </b></p>
    <p><ul><li>Consistent work is better than small bursts.
      <li>Having 2 people instead of 1 working on a project is more than 2x efficiency.
        <li>Focus on how you can help people right away.
          <li>Minimize friction of each user interaction.
            <li>Sit down and listen to the user&rsquo;s story.
              <li>Being surrounded by passionate and smart people is amazing.
                <li>Building a great team is about doing the work yourself (startups). </ul></p>

    <p>Vision: Change how live music is experienced.</p>
      <p> Mission: Help bands and venues book live shows.</p>

    <p>The company was founded in 2015 while I was attending university at the John Molson School of Business in Montreal. </p>

    <p>With my first year being spent in residence in Loyola Campus, I had the opportunity to meet groups of artists who had moved to Montreal with the goal of &lsquo;making it&rsquo; - to live through their art.</p>

    <p>I soon realized a universal problem for all the artists I talked to, a key element to profiting off their work was events.</p>

    <p>Events in themselves are difficult to organize.o They require a project management mindset, and for people who wanted to focus their energies on making art, running an event was at the bottom of their priority list.</p>

    <p>Having grown up surrounded by engineers, I felt there must be a more hands-off approach to organizing artistic events. </p>

    <p>But after researching alternatives I felt the needs of my friends weren&rsquo;t being met, and I wanted to change that.</p>

    <p name="projects"><h4>Projects</h4></p>
    <p>Discovery</p>
    Goal: Understand fully what a working product would look like that fit the needs of future users.</p>

    <p>Defined initial scope of project to be focussed on live music based on market analysis and my network. Applied and was accepted to District 3 (Concordia funded Startup Incubator) as a solo founder to learn from mentors and be surrounded by like minded people. Interviewed over 40% of Montreal&rsquo;s music venue program managers to determine their booking processes. Pitched idea gaining conceptual buy-in from 60%. Interviewed over 100 different bands and independent musicians to determine their overall goals with live music, while mapping their current processes for booking shows.</p>

    <p>Minimum Product</p>
    <p>Goal: Have a working system to help bands book live shows.</p>

    <p>Reviewed interview notes to find underlying elements relevant to both bands and venues Collected key venue information of over 100 venues in and around Montreal for bands through a second round of face to face interviews, phone calls, and online research. Reached out to bands in my network looking to book live shows - helped them define what they were looking for and recommended venues based on style. Helped bands draft proposal and reached out to venue booking managers with all critical information necessary for a show. Helped 60 bands book shows with 7 venues leading to 300 less emails and a happier booking experience for both parties.</p>

    <p>Initial Product Development</p>
    <p> Goal: Develop a product handling operational parts of booking live shows.</p>

    <p>Reached out through my network and online platforms (AngelList) to build a team of volunteers. Interviewed 2-3 candidates per role to find best role &amp; culture fit. (brought on 2 developers, 1 designer, 1 operations, 1 marketing). Held weekly scrum sessions involving team at my apartment - walked through key value points for stakeholders and engaged team in prioritization of work. Worked closely with developers to ensure scope didn&rsquo;t continuously expand and features were prioritized effectively.</p>

    <p name="learnings"><h4> Learnings</h4></p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to fully write down everything I learned while trying to build this company.</p>

    <p>The biggest, I feel, is a good idea will get you nowhere if you don&rsquo;t put in consistent work.</p>

    <p>I was attending university, was a part of the varsity frisbee team, two case competition teams, and worked a part time job in a kitchen, while trying to build this company. </p>

    <p>It never went where it could because I didn&rsquo;t make the time to invest.</p>

    <p>We took about 10 months off sporadically for exams, summer, and other reasons. </p>

    <p>In the end, I found some students looking to continue helping bands with the information we learned, and I moved to Toronto for Peersight.</p>

    <p>---</p>
    <p>Learnings: </p>
    <p>Consistent work is better than small bursts. Having 2 people instead of 1 working on a project is more than 2x efficiency. Focus on how you can help people right away. Minimize friction of each user interaction. Sit down and listen to the user&rsquo;s story. Being surrounded by passionate and smart people is amazing. Building a great team is about doing the work yourself (startups). </p>
